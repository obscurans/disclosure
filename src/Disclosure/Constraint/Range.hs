Portability : portable

Defines types for unbounded and bounded ranges, which are closed intervals over
ordered types, represented by a 'Tuple2'. For unbounded ranges, interval bounds
are wrapped in 'Maybe', with 'Nothing' representing the appropriate infinity for
half-open or open ranges. For bounded ranges, 'minBound', 'maxBound' are treated
as infinities.

{-| A validated closed interval over an ordered type, represented as a boxed
@'Maybe' ('Tuple2' ('Maybe' a))@ for [low, high]. The inner 'Maybe' injects
'Nothing' as a representation of infinity for half-open or open intervals.
Ranges are valid if low ≤ high. Invalid and\/or empty ranges are (outer)
'Nothing'.

boxed @'Maybe' ('Tuple2' a)@ for [low, high]. Ranges are valid if @minBound@ ≤
low ≤ high ≤ @maxBound@, and @minBound@, @maxBound@ also stand for infinities.
Invalid and\/or empty ranges are 'Nothing'.
