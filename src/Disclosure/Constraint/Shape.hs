Defines three types: 'SuitRange' for a validated range of lengths in an
unspecified suit, as a closed interval of integers within [0, 13]; 'ShapeRange'
for a validated range of hand shapes, as a 4-tuple of 'SuitRange's;
'ShapeMinimal' is also a range of hand shapes but is minimized for
human-readibility.

Hand ranges are conceptualized as a combination of any number of ≤ and ≥
constraints on individual suit lengths, represented by the 'SuitRange's, with
normalization according to one of two schema:

* /Closed/ form, corresponding to 'ShapeRange', infers all derived constraints
based on the requirement that a hand contain exactly 13 cards, and presents the
most restrictive form. For example, ≥5♠ implies ≤8♥, ≤8♦, and ≤8♣
simultaneously.

* /Open/ form, corresponding to 'ShapeMinimal', conceptually uses the minimal
number of individual constraints such that the full shape is derivable. Note
that the intent is for clarity of human viewing and the normalization rules
reflect that. For example, knowing =6♠ and =6♥ is sufficient to derive 6♠ 6♥
0-1♦ 0-1♣; ≤1♦ is human-redundant.

'ShapeRange' is isomorphic to 'ShapeMinimal'.

{-| Constructs, validates, and normalizes a 'ShapeRange'. Normalization takes
the most restrictive bound via the following rules:

* For any suit @X@, let @M3@ be the sum of the max-bounds of all other suits.
Then @X@ must be at least @min' = 13 - M3@ cards or it is impossible to have as
many as 13 total cards. The stricter (greater) of @min'@ and the original
min-bound of @X@ is used.

* For any suit @X@, let @m3@ be the sum of the min-bounds of all other suits.
Then @X@ must be at most @max' = 13 - m3@ cards or it is impossible to satisfy
the other suit minima within 13 total cards. The stricter (lower) of @max'@ and
the original max-bound of @X@ is used.

No other derived constraints exist; this is an idempotent operation, ergo
normalizing. The derived constraints may cause an empty (unsatisfiable)
'ShapeRange' even if all component 'SuitRange's are individually valid.

{-| Converts a 'ShapeRange' into its isomorphic 'ShapeMinimal' form. Given that
the range starts out in 'ShapeRange' form, with maximally restrictive
constraints, normalization relaxes (removes) the constraints and takes the
\"best\" (author-preferred) human-readable form via the following rules:

* All equality constraints are never relaxed.

* If 12 cards are known from min-bounds, all remaining non-equality max-bounds
are relaxed. This corresponds to turning 5♠ 4-5♥ 4-5♦ 1-♣ into 5♠ 4+♥ 4+♦, an
\"add last card\" type of shape. Equivalent to ignoring the immediate next rule.

* Else, if all ranges are within 1 card's length, no constraints are relaxed at
all. This prevents \"remove a card\" type shapes such as 5♠ 4-5♥ 3-4♦ 1-♣ from
being turned into 5♠ 5-♥ 3-♦ 1-♣, deemed harder to read.

* Consider the derived max-bounds listed in 'toShapeR', which depend on the
/min/-bounds. If using the min-bounds alone, a max-bound can be derived, then it
is unnecessary and can be relaxed.

* Consider the derived min-bounds listed in 'toShapeR', which depend on the
(new) max-bounds. If using the max-bounds alone, a min-bound can be derived,
then it is unnecessary and can be relaxed. However, any min-bound which is 4 or
more is not relaxed, as turning 6♠ 4+♥ 2-♦ 1-♣ into 6♠ 2-♦ 1-♣ is deemed to not
improve readability.

Note that while either all max- or all min-bounds can be relaxed simultanously
due to independence, doing both simultaneously is incorrect (try a fully
specific single shape). The choice of relaxing max-bounds first corresponds to
preferring 11+♠ -♦ -♣ over 2-♥ -♦ -♣. These rules are idempotent, ergo
normalizing.
