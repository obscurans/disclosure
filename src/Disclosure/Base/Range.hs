Description : Datatypes for unbounded and bounded ranges

Portability : portable

Defines types for unbounded and bounded ranges, which are closed intervals over
ordered types, represented by a 2-tuple. For unbounded ranges, interval bounds
are wrapped in 'Maybe', with 'Nothing' representing the appropriate infinity for
half-open or open ranges. For bounded ranges, 'minBound', 'maxBound' are treated
as infinities.
