Description : Datatypes for unbounded and bounded ranges

Defines types for unbounded and bounded ranges, which are closed intervals over
ordered types, represented by a 2-tuple. For unbounded ranges, interval bounds
are wrapped in 'Maybe', with 'Nothing' representing the appropriate infinity for
half-open or open ranges. For bounded ranges, 'minBound', 'maxBound' are treated
as infinities.

{-| A validated, nonempty closed interval over an ordered type, represented as a
boxed @('Maybe' a, 'Maybe' a)@ for [low, high]. The 'Maybe' injects 'Nothing' as
a representation of infinity for half-open or open intervals. Ranges are valid
if low ≤ high; empty ranges are invalid.

infinities; empty ranges are invalid.
